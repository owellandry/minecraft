# PlayerTracking: Enable/disable tracking of player names to their IP-Addresses.
#   - Persistence can be disabled with the toggle in the Storage section.

#     and they will be shown for outdated clients.
# Unknown: Placeholder replacement if the real value is unknown.
# Favicon: Options for the creation / downloading of favicons:
#  - RecursiveFolderSearch: Also search for favicons in sub directories.
#  - SkinSource: The URL to get the Minecraft Skins from. (%s -> player name)
#  - ResizeStrategy: The strategy used to resize too small or too big favicons.
#      NONE (keep them as is, will probably fail), SCALE (scale them to the correct size)

# This section is only for the Bukkit plugin of ServerListPlus.
# ProtocolLib: (DISABLE|AUTO|ENABLE) Decides if ProtocolLib should be used by ServerListPlus.
#   Generally, AUTO (the default) is a good choice: ProtocolLib is used on Spigot for
#   full functionality, but disabled on Paper because it is not needed there.
#   Note that this might cause other plugins that make use of ProtocolLib to overwrite
#   the changes made by ServerListPlus. In that case, try setting ENABLE instead.

ProtocolLib: AUTO
